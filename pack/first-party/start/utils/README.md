# Utils plugin

Just some handy functions and commands in an easy to add package.


## Installation

You can just dump this directory into `<VIMHOME>/pack/*/start/` and it should auto-load. You can verify by opening a file and running:

    :scriptnames
    
You should see the `utils.vim` file loaded somewhere in the list.

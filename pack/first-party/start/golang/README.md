$ cat <PATH-TO-GO-INSTALLATION>/misc/editors
For information about plugins and other support for Go in editors and shells,
see this page on the Go Wiki:

```

That url points to [vim-go](https://github.com/fatih/vim-go) but looking through the plugin it seemed like overkill for what I need right now (April 30, 2024).

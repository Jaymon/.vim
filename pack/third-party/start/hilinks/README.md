# Hilinks

The version I'm using is from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gerw/vim-HiLinkTrace/refs/heads/master/plugin/hilinks.vim), I just downloaded it and created the plugin.

I first tried to use a `.vba` version but it didn't work even though it seems like it was a later version. This version worked though and did what I wanted which was to show the highlighting trace and confirm that my own custom code that runs in my status bar isn't completely accurate for certain syntaxes (cough, typescript's builtin syntax, cough).

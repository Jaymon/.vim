Removes the vim view file that is loaded when a file is loaded

The .vimrc does mkview when exiting and loadview when loading a file but
when modifying plugins or making changes those files can keep the changes
from being reflected in the file, in order to get the changes to show up,
the view file needs to be deleted, which is what this script does.
